# mdbook tools

A repository of tools that can be used with [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), particularily for collections of fiction works.

All of the code in this repository is licensed under the terms of the MIT License or the Apache 2.0 License, at your option.

## add-copyright

add-copyright is a preprocessor that can be used. It conditionally replaces the string `!{#copyright}` in markdown files with the content of a file named `COPYRIGHT-STUB.md` (or specified in the config) relative to the book source directory.
Relative links are repointed to keep the target consistent with the stub file.

The program produces a binary called `mdbook-add-copyright`, so you can enable the preprocessor simply by adding `[preprocessor.add-copyright]` to your `book.toml`.

### Config

In addition to the config keys for all preprocessors, the `add-copyright` preprocessor accepts the following config keys.
All keys are optional

```toml
[preprocessor.add-copyright]
# The file to use for the replacement, relative to the source directory of the book
# defaults to `COPYRIGHT-STUB.md`
copyright-stub = "path/to/copyright-stub.md"
# Specifies the set of files the replacement is performed on
# If omitted, includes all chapters specified in the book's `SUMMARY.md`
include = ["file1.md", "file2.md"]
# Specifies the set of files the replacement is not performed on
# defaults to an empty list
exclude = ["file3.md"]

# Additional config per-renderer.
# Inherits the global configuration
[preprocessor.add-copyright.<renderer>]
# Specifies the set of files the replacement is performed on when preprocessing the input for <renderer>
# If omitted, includes all chapters specified in the book's `SUMMARY.md`
include = ["file1.md", "file2.md"]
# Specifies the set of files the replacement is not performed on when preprocessing the input for <renderer>
# defaults to an empty list
exclude = ["file3.md"]
```

#### File Sets

The `include` and `exclude` key (and the renderer-specific variants) allows for granular control over the files replacement is performed on - only the files specified in `include` are included, and none of the files specified by `exclude` are included (regardless of whether they appear in an `include`). To affect all markdown files in the book (except for explicitly excluded ones), you can omit the `include` key. 

The files are relative to the src directory - currently the values must be direct paths, globbing is not yet supported (but may be in the future). 

When render-specific file sets are specified, the `include` set is an intersection between the global config and the per-renderer config, and the `exclude` set is a union - the renderer specific config only removes files that are included for all renderers.

Note that when a file is not included, the preprocessor is still run on that file. The string `!{#copyright}` is instead removed from the string. 
This is useful for appending copyright info to the bottom of each chapter when using a renderer that displays chapters in separate pages (such as the `html` backend), but omitting it when multiple chapters may be appended together (such as the `epub-fancy` backend).

## epub-fancy

epub-fancy is an mdbook backend that emits epub files. This backend supports substantial configuration to properly support a number of epub features.

Like the `add-copyright` preprocessor, this installs a binary called `mdbook-epub-fancy`, so the backend can be enabled directly by adding `[output.epub-fancy]` to your `book.toml`.

### Config

The config fields supported by the `epub-fancy` backend are:

```toml
[output.epub-fancy]
# Sets which outputs are provided,
# Valid values `full` (generate a single epub file for the entire book), `part` (generate an epub file for each Header separated part), or `chapter` (generate individual epub files for each chapter - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
# Multiple options can be specified as follows, each type of output is generated
# output=["full", "part"]
output="<type>"

# Not Yet Implemented:
# Save intermediate files generated by the backend in the output directory (under a directory named by the output file id when multiple types are specified or the type is not `full`)
# The current implementation writes all files directory to the zip container  and does not currently support generating the relevant temp files
# The option is parsed (validated as a `bool`) but ignored by the renderer. It may be implemented in the future. 
# save-temps = false

# When generating `part` or `chapter` outputs, always include these files in each output.
always-include = ["list/of/files.md"]

# Allows specifying the unique identifier (dc:identifier) for the epub package documents in each output file
[output.epub-fancy.file-ids]
# Allows specifying the unique identifier when generating the `full` output.
# Exactly one of `uuid`, `oid`, or `isbn` may be specified (otherwise the table must be omitted)
# The default is a suitably unique `uuid` (current implementation generates a v7 id based on the current time)
[output.epub-fancy.file-ids.full]
# Specifies a unique identifier that is a Universally Unique Identifier (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122)
uuid = "<uuid>"
# Specifies a unique identifier that is an Object Identifier
oid = "<oid>"
# Specifies a unique identifier that is an ISBN (ISBN 10 or ISBN 13)
isbn = "<isbn>"

# Allows specifying the unique identifier for specific part or chapter outputs
# Exactly one of `uuid`, `oid`, or `isbn` may be specified (otherwise the table must be omitted)
# The default is a suitably unique `uuid` (current implementation generates a v7 id based on the current time)
# The key is derived from the part or chapter title
[output.epub-fancy.file-ids.'<output-id>']
# Specifies a unique identifier that is a Universally Unique Identifier (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122)
uuid = "<uuid>"
# Specifies a unique identifier that is an Object Identifier
oid = "<oid>"
# Specifies a unique identifier that is an ISBN (ISBN 10 or ISBN 13)
isbn = "<isbn>"


# Advanced configuration option - changes the name of the epub output files
[output.epub-fancy.output-files]
# Specifies the name of the file for the `full` output
# Defaults to a name derived from the book title
full = "full.epub"
# Specifies the name of the file for the given identified output
# Used for part and chapter outputs
# The key for a given part or chapter is derived from the part/chapter title
# The default is the key with `.epub` appended
'<output-id>'="<output-id>.epub"
```

### Output Ids

When using the `file-ids` or `output-files` configuration tables, outputs corresponding to the `part` or `chapter` output type use a computed output id.

These types are computed as follows:
* For part outputs, if the part heading in the `SUMMARY.md` file contains a cmark extension heading id specifier (`.id` inside `{}` after the text of the header), the exact id is used. Note that whitespace ends the id specification.
* For chapter outputs, the check is made on the first h1 heading of the chapters file, provided that no input other than blank lines appear before that heading
* Otherwise, the whole title specified in `SUMMARY.md` is converted as follows:
  1. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed.
  2. Nonwhitespace Characters other than letters, digits, and the characters `_` and `-` are removed.
  3. Each nonempty sequence of whitespace is replaced with a single `-`.
  4. Each upper case letter is replaced with the corresponding lower case letter.


The computation for output ids is considered stable, and will not be changed between major versions of the project.

Note that currently mdbook does not have support for heading extension support in `SUMMARY.md` specifically, so on non-aware renderers (including the builtin `html` backend), heading extension specifiers will be displayed verbatim. 

### Future Work

Missing features:
* Support per-chapter epub outputs
* Support save-temps = true
* Remove heading extension specifiers from the `nav` document
* Allow configuring whether the `nav` document should appear in the spine (and thus be displayed)
* Check when markdown files use features that require manifest attributes to be set.

Potential Future Directions:
* Support basic styling via built-in or user-specified css
* Support additional OCF container format options, like signatures.
* Support additional epub metadata, such as subject information
* Support math equations via MathML

Non-planned features:
* encryption and epub rights management: Fork button is top right of your screen. PRs not welcome. \
